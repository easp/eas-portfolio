# Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository is a portfolio of some of my data analysis work.

At present it contains projects completed as part of Dataquest's Data Analyst in Python training. These projects provided a starting point in terms of datasets and a goal, and suggested steps, but implementation was largely left to the student (i.e me)

## Projects

- *Ebay Autos Dataset Analysis*
- *Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors*
- *Cleaning and Analysis of Employee Exit Surveys*
- *Cleaning, Merging and Analysis of New York City High School Data*

The following projects used Python and the Pandas library for data analysis and  matplotlib for visualization.

- *[college_majors](college_majors/)* Visualization and of earnings by college major across various dimensions.
- *[ebay_car_sales](ebay_car_sales/)* Cleaning and analysis of a 50,000 row dataset of eBay Autos listings.
