# Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository is a portfolio of some of my data analysis work.

At present it contains projects completed as part of Dataquest's [Data Analyst in Python training](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst/). These projects provided a starting point in terms of datasets and a goal, and suggested steps, but implementation was largely left to the student (i.e me).

## Projects

The following projects used Python and the Pandas library for data analysis and  matplotlib for visualization.

- *[college_majors](college_majors/)* Visualization and of earnings by college major across various dimensions.
- *[ebay_car_sales](ebay_car_sales/)* Cleaning and analysis of a 50,000 row dataset of eBay Autos listings.
- *[exit_surveys](exit_surveys/)* Cleaning, merging and analysis of two employee exit interview datasets.
- *[nyc_schools](nyc_schools/)* Cleaning, merging and analysis of six datasets about New York City schools.
